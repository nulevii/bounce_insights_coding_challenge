This is a project built with TypeScript, Next.js, React, Redux Toolkit, Redux Thunks and Express.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install `frontedn` and `backend` repositories and rename them accordingly.

2. Open the `backend` folder in your terminal and run the following command to install the dependencies:
```npm install```

3. Go back to the root folder and open the `frontend` folder in your terminal. Run the following command to install the dependencies:
```npm install```

4. Run the following command to build the project:
```npm run build```

5. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the Express server.

6. Run the following command to start the Next.js app with the Express server:
